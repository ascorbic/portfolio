My second ChatGPT project was Font Institute, which was based on my love of
typography. It is a vanilla HTML and JavaScript site, with the chat backend
running in a Netlify Edge Function. It asks the API to return the font and
message in a JSON object, and if it recommends a font then it dynamically loads
the font from the Google Font API, and uses it to render the sample text.
