Chalkstream is a serverless live video streaming platform. It encodes a video
stream in the browser, using a WebAssembly build of FFmpeg, and then sends the
stream to an edge function which stores the chunks in Netlify Blobs.

A separate edge function generates an HLS manifest from the stored chunks, which
are served to the user's browser.
