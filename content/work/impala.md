Impala is a very simple Vite-based metaframework and static site generator. It
supports React and Preact. I built it because there was no simple React static
site generator available. It was designed as a modern, MPA equivalent of
create-react-app.

It supports filesystem routing with a syntax like Astro, data fetching inspired
by Next.js and Astro, route-level code splitting and optionally JS-free.
