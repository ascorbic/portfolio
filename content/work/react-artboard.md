A React libary for realistic, freeform sketching and painting. It includes a set
of brushes that are designed to be more interesting and realistic than the
standard canvas brushes. This includes a pencil with automatic shading, a
watercolour brush that includes realistic spreading and mixing, and a tool which
models the individual bristles of a paintbrush.
