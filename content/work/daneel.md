Inspired by creating [Mixie](/projects/mixie) and
[Font Institute](/projects/font-institute), I wanted to create a tool that would
allow anyone to create their own Chat GPT-powered chat bot. I created Daneel,
named after the robot from Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, which allows you to
create a chat bot that can be deployed to Netlify with a single click.

The frontwend uses [Impala](/projects/impala), and the backend is a Netlify Edge
Function.
