I built this app because I got a Google Pixel Watch and wanted a good project to
learn to build for it. I've built other apps that use the UK train times APIs,
and this seemed like a good fit for a watch app.

I became a big fan of Kotlin while building this app, and developing for the
watch was a fun challenge. I'd previously built a watch app for the Pebble, but
this was my first time building for a modern smartwatch.
